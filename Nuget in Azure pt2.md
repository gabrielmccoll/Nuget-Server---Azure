# A Free Powershell Repository with CI CD
### ...and I do most of the work for you (Part 2 of 3 - the Nuget Server and finishing it off)


Well hello stalwart chums! 
Hopefully the previous post wasnâ€™t too rough for you. 
It was also potentially the more boring bit, but give me a chance, I can be more boring.






7. Clone Repo down in Visual Studio 2017
8. New Asp.net Empty 
9. Add Nuget.Server package 
10. Powershell  New-Guid 
11. Use Guid as API key in webconfig 		//improve this 
12. Commit and Sync
5. Create Yaml build 
6. Switch on CI, do a manual build
13. Build should complete
14. Create Release pipeline > to  Azure Webapp with CI
15. Pick the Service Endpoint created in Azure Webapp settings.  
16. Do Release ,  should now be up and running.
